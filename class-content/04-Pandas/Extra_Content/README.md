### 1. Data Clean-Up I

* Data is inherently dirty. It often contains more information than is needed, columns are often mislabeled, and values are often missing or in the wrong format. This activity will require you to use most of what you've learned this week to fix just such a problem in a real-world data set.

### 2. Data Clean-Up II

* The next activity will require you to clean and explore the same dataset in order to generate a very different set of summary data.
